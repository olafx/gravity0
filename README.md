# gravity0

(This is old, see experiments0 instead.)

A showcase of gravity solvers in C++, and initial condition generators in Python.

For educational purposes.

Small, but proper.


## King Sampling

Sampling realistic tidally limited star clusters. (King 1966)

## Cosmological Quantum Fluctuations

These can be generated too for periodic field based cosmological solvers, in 2D or 3D.

## Integration

Only implemented basic integrators so far. (n-body leapfrog and Verlet)
Field based periodic cosmological integrator coming up next. Hoping to produce a 3D cosmic web and some great 2D detail.
Also want to make some time adaptive and faster-than-quadratic n-body solvers.
